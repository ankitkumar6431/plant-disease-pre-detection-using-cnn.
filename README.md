# plant-disease-pre-detection-using-cnn.
This project focuses on the early detection of plant diseases using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to develop a model that can analyze leaf images and accurately identify signs of diseases at their initial stages, enabling timely intervention and reducing cro
